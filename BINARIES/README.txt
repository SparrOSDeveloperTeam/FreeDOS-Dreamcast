The files in this folder are the files to build your own ROM of the Fake86 Emulator for Dreamcast.

To build this simply put "DRIVE0.RAW" and "IP.BIN" in this folder. Then use your Dreamcast building tool (we recommend BootDreams on Windows) to create a ROM. The ROM must be in the Data/Audio format.
